/*! Command queues.

    Queues are the execution paths of the graphical processing units. These process
    submitted commands buffers.

    There are different types of queues, which can only handle associated command buffers.
    `CommandQueue<B, C>` has the capability defined by `C`: graphics, compute and transfer.
